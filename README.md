# Smart Parking System using Python and YOLO

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Smart Parking System** that uses **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for real-time vehicle detection and parking management. It supports **two-wheelers and four-wheelers**, applies **masking techniques**, and includes a **waiting queue for vehicles** when the parking lot is full.

## 🔧 Features
-  **Vehicle Detection** using YOLO
-  **Automatic Parking Slot Allocation** for two-wheelers and four-wheelers
-  **Masking Application** to filter out irrelevant objects
-  **Waiting Queue Mechanism** when parking is full
-  **Database Management** for tracking parked vehicles

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 
- **Object Detection:** YOLO (You Only Look Once) 
- **Database:** MySQL (or any preferred database) 
- **GUI (if applicable):** Tkinter / PyQt / Flask for Web UI
